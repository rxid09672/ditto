  A macOS prank module that leverages the built-in text-to-speech
  functionality to generate audible output on the target system.
  This module uses the native "say" command to convert text input
  into spoken audio through the system's speakers.

  The module supports various voice options including different
  accents and languages available in macOS, allowing for customized
  audio output. This can be used to create humorous or disruptive
  effects by making the computer speak unexpected messages or
  phrases without user interaction.

  The text-to-speech functionality can be particularly effective
  for creating psychological impact through unexpected audio
  output, especially in quiet environments or when users are
  not expecting the system to produce speech. This module is
  commonly used for pranks and social engineering scenarios
  where audible disruption can create confusion or amusement.
