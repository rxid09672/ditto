  A macOS prank module that modifies system backgrounds to create
  visual disruption or humorous effects. This module can change
  both the desktop background and the login screen background
  using custom images to alter the user's visual experience.

  The module uses macOS system commands to modify background
  settings, targeting both the desktop picture through Finder
  automation and the login screen background through system
  cache manipulation. This allows for comprehensive visual
  modification that affects both the current user session and
  future login attempts.

  The background modification can be particularly effective
  for creating psychological impact through unexpected visual
  changes, especially when using humorous, shocking, or
  confusing images. This module is commonly used for pranks
  and social engineering scenarios where visual disruption
  can create confusion or amusement while maintaining
  system functionality.
