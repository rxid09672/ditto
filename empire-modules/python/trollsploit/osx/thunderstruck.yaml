  Launches Safari browser in the background and automatically navigates to
  the AC/DC "Thunderstruck" music video on YouTube while setting system
  volume to maximum. This module performs a humorous prank by playing
  loud music without user interaction. Uses macOS system commands to
  control volume settings and launch Safari with specific URL parameters.
