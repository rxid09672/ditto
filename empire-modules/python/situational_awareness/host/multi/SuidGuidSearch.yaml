  Searches for files with SUID (Set User ID) or GUID (Set Group ID)
  permissions set, which can be exploited for privilege escalation.
  Uses the find command to recursively search the filesystem for
  files with elevated permissions that execute with the privileges
  of the file owner or group. Displays detailed file information
  including permissions, owner, group, and file path.
