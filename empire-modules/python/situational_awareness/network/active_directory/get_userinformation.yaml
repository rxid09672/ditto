  An Active Directory enumeration module that retrieves comprehensive user profile
  information for a specified user account within the target domain. This module
  performs detailed reconnaissance to gather complete user attributes and account
  details for intelligence gathering and targeting purposes.

  The module queries Active Directory via LDAP to extract all available user
  attributes including account details, contact information, organizational data,
  and security settings. This information is essential for understanding the
  user's role, privileges, and potential access to sensitive resources within
  the domain.

  The enumeration results provide critical intelligence for social engineering,
  privilege escalation, and lateral movement by revealing detailed user profiles
  and organizational relationships. This module is fundamental for user
  reconnaissance and helps operators build comprehensive profiles of potential
  targets for credential harvesting and targeted attacks.
