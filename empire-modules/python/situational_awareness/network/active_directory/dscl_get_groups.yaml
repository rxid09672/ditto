  A macOS-specific Active Directory enumeration module that leverages the
  Directory Service command line utility (dscl) to query all groups within
  the target domain using the current user's authentication context. This
  module performs essential reconnaissance to understand organizational
  structure and privilege distribution through native macOS directory services.

  The module uses dscl to query Active Directory for all group objects
  without requiring explicit LDAP credentials, relying instead on the current
  user's domain authentication. This approach is particularly effective in
  macOS environments where dscl provides seamless Active Directory integration
  and can access domain information through the system's built-in directory
  service framework.

  The enumeration results provide critical intelligence for privilege escalation
  and lateral movement by revealing the complete group structure within the
  domain. This module is fundamental for macOS-based domain reconnaissance
  and helps operators identify potential targets for group-based attacks and
  understand the organizational hierarchy for targeted social engineering
  campaigns using native macOS capabilities.
