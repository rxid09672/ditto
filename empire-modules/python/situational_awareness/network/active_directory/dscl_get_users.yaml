  A macOS-specific Active Directory enumeration module that leverages the
  Directory Service command line utility (dscl) to query all user accounts
  within the target domain using the current user's authentication context.
  This module performs essential reconnaissance to identify potential targets
  for credential harvesting and social engineering attacks.

  The module uses dscl to query Active Directory for all user objects without
  requiring explicit LDAP credentials, relying instead on the current user's
  domain authentication. This approach is particularly effective in macOS
  environments where dscl provides native Active Directory integration and
  can access domain information through the system's directory service
  framework without additional authentication overhead.

  The enumeration results provide critical intelligence for user targeting
  and social engineering by revealing the complete user base within the
  domain. This module is fundamental for macOS-based domain reconnaissance
  and helps operators identify potential targets for credential harvesting,
  privilege escalation, and targeted attacks based on user roles and
  organizational structure using native macOS directory service capabilities.
