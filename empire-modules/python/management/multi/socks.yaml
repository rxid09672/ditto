  Establishes a SOCKSv5 proxy tunnel through the Empire agent
  using the AlmondRocks (AROX) relay system. Creates a proxy
  connection that routes traffic through the compromised system
  to extend network access and enable lateral movement. Requires
  a standalone AlmondRocks server to be configured and running
  for the relay to connect to.
