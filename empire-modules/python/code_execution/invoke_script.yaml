  Dynamically loads and executes Python scripts from remote URLs or base64-encoded strings
  to enable flexible code execution capabilities. Supports both direct script execution
  and function calls with parameters within loaded scripts. This module provides a
  powerful mechanism for executing custom Python payloads without requiring persistent
  file storage on the target system.
