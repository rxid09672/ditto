  Removes Empire persistence mechanisms by unloading and deleting
  LaunchAgent/LaunchDaemon plist files and their associated
  program files. Uses launchctl to unload the service from
  the system, then removes both the plist configuration file
  and the executable binary or script. Provides cleanup
  functionality for removing persistence mechanisms and
  covering tracks after operations. Supports custom paths
  for both the plist file and the associated program file.
  Useful for post-exploitation cleanup, removing evidence,
  and maintaining operational security by eliminating
  persistence artifacts.
