  Establishes persistence by configuring a macOS LoginHook that
  executes the Empire agent when users log into the system.
  Uses the defaults command to set the loginHook property in
  the system preferences, which runs a specified script during
  the login process. Requires sudo privileges to modify system
  preferences and configure the login hook. The hook script
  is executed for every user login, providing persistent
  access across user sessions and system reboots. Useful for
  maintaining long-term access to compromised macOS systems
  through legitimate system mechanisms.
