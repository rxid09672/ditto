  Creates and installs a macOS LaunchAgent plist file in the user's home
  directory to establish persistence across user sessions and system reboots.
  The LaunchAgent is configured to automatically start the Empire agent when
  the user logs in, providing continuous access to the compromised system
  without requiring administrative privileges. The module creates a properly
  formatted plist file with the specified name and installs it in the user's
  LaunchAgents directory. Includes safety checks for security software like
  LittleSnitch and sandbox detection to avoid detection. Provides reliable
  user-level persistence mechanism that survives user logouts and system
  restarts.
