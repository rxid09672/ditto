  Creates and installs a macOS LaunchAgent plist file to establish persistence
  across user sessions and system reboots. The LaunchAgent is configured to
  automatically start the Empire agent when the user logs in, providing
  continuous access to the compromised system. The module creates a properly
  formatted plist file with the specified daemon name and installs it in the
  user's LaunchAgents directory. Includes safety checks for security software
  like LittleSnitch and sandbox detection to avoid detection. Provides
  reliable persistence mechanism that survives user logouts and system
  restarts.
