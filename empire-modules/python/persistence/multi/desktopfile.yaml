  Creates and installs a desktop entry file in the ~/.config/autostart
  directory to establish persistence on Linux systems with graphical
  user interfaces. The desktop file follows the freedesktop.org
  specification and automatically launches the Empire agent when
  the user logs into the desktop environment. Creates a properly
  formatted .desktop file with the specified name and configures
  it to execute the Empire launcher script. Includes functionality
  to remove the persistence mechanism for cleanup. Useful for
  establishing persistence on Linux desktop systems and maintaining
  access across user sessions and system reboots.
