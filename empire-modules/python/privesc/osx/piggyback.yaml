  A macOS-specific privilege escalation technique that exploits sudo session
  management to spawn a new Empire agent with elevated privileges. This module
  leverages an existing sudo session to execute commands with root privileges
  without requiring password re-authentication.

  The technique works by:
  - Detecting and utilizing an active sudo session on the system
  - Bypassing the normal sudo authentication requirements
  - Executing the Empire stager with root privileges
  - Establishing a new high-integrity agent process

  This method is particularly effective because it:
  - Requires no password input from the attacker
  - Works silently in the background
  - Leverages legitimate sudo session mechanisms
  - Provides immediate privilege escalation

  Compatibility: This technique works on macOS versions up to El Capitan (10.11).
  Apple patched this vulnerability in subsequent releases, making it ineffective
  on newer macOS versions. This makes it a valuable technique for targeting
  legacy macOS systems that may still be in use in enterprise environments.
