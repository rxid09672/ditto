  Exploits a critical privilege escalation vulnerability in macOS Yosemite (10.10)
  through the DYLD_PRINT_TO_FILE environment variable. This vulnerability allows
  unprivileged users to write to arbitrary files with root privileges, including
  system files that would normally be protected.

  The exploit works by:
  - Leveraging the DYLD_PRINT_TO_FILE environment variable to redirect dynamic
    linker output to arbitrary file locations
  - Exploiting a flaw in the dynamic linker's file handling mechanism
  - Writing malicious content to system files with elevated privileges
  - Overwriting critical system files to establish persistence or gain root access

  This vulnerability affects all versions of macOS Yosemite (10.10.x) and was
  patched in subsequent macOS releases. The exploit is particularly dangerous
  because it can overwrite system files and potentially trigger endpoint protection
  systems due to the file modification behavior.

  WARNING: This exploit will overwrite and delete files on the target system,
  which may trigger security monitoring systems and could potentially cause
  system instability. Use with caution in production environments.
