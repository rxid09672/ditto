  A privilege escalation technique that creates a malicious alias in the
  user's .bash_profile to intercept and hijack the sudo command. This module establishes
  a backdoor by modifying the shell environment to execute a stager payload whenever
  the user runs sudo, while transparently passing the original command through to the
  legitimate sudo binary.

  The technique works by:
  - Creating an alias in .bash_profile that redirects 'sudo' to a custom function
  - The function executes the Empire stager to establish a high-privilege agent
  - The original sudo command is then executed normally to maintain stealth
  - This allows for persistent privilege escalation without requiring password entry

  This method is particularly effective because it leverages the user's existing sudo
  privileges and creates a persistent mechanism for elevated access. The backdoor
  remains active across shell sessions and can be triggered by any sudo command
  execution.
