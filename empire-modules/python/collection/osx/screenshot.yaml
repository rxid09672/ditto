  Captures a screenshot of the macOS desktop using the native screencapture utility
  and returns the image data in PNG format. This module provides visual reconnaissance
  capabilities by capturing the current state of the user's desktop, including
  open applications, documents, and user activity. The screenshot is temporarily
  saved to disk, converted to base64 format for transmission, and then securely
  deleted.
