  scanning process memory for authentication data. Leverages
  techniques similar to the original MimiPenguin tool to locate
  and extract plaintext credentials stored in memory by various
  applications and services. Requires root privileges to access
  process memory and scan for sensitive authentication data.
  Useful for credential harvesting, password recovery, and
  post-exploitation reconnaissance on Linux systems.
