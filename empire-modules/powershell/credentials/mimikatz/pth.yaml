  Performs Pass-the-Hash (PTH) attack using Mimikatz's sekurlsa::pth functionality
  to create a new process with a specific user's NTLM hash. Creates a new process
  with the specified user's credentials without requiring the plaintext password.
  The new process runs with the impersonated user's security context, allowing
  access to resources that the target user has permissions to access. Essential
  for lateral movement and privilege escalation when only password hashes are
  available instead of plaintext credentials.
