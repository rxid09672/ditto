  A reconnaissance module that performs local account enumeration and
  network-based brute force attacks on Windows member servers. This
  module leverages the agent's current credentials or provided
  credentials to query local user accounts and then attempts to
  authenticate against discovered accounts using a specified password list.

  The module first enumerates local user accounts on target servers
  using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) or Active Directory
  queries. It then performs online brute force attacks against each
  discovered account using the provided password list. This technique
  is particularly effective on older Windows Server versions (2003/2008)
  where domain accounts may have broader enumeration permissions.

  This approach is inspired by the Xfocus X-Scan methodology and
  provides a systematic way to identify weak local account credentials
  across multiple servers. The module includes options for verbose
  output to track failed login attempts and discovered users, making
  it useful for security assessments and penetration testing scenarios
  where credential harvesting is a priority.

comments:
  - Inspired by Xfocus X-Scan. Recent Windows versions won't allow you to query userinfo
    using regular domain accounts, but on 2003/2008 member servers, the module might
    prove to be useful.
