  A reconnaissance module that performs network scanning to identify
  potentially vulnerable web services across a specified network range.
  This module conducts HTTP/HTTPS port scanning and path enumeration
  to discover web applications and services that may be susceptible
  to various web-based attacks.

  The module scans target hosts and ports to identify web services
  and then performs path enumeration using a dictionary-based approach
  to discover potentially interesting endpoints. It can identify web
  applications, administrative interfaces, default installations,
  and other web services that might be vulnerable to exploitation.

  This technique is inspired by mattifestation's Get-HttpStatus from
  PowerSploit and provides a systematic approach to web service
  discovery. The module includes options for SSL/TLS scanning,
  customizable timeouts, threading controls, and output filtering
  to focus on specific response codes or discovered services. This
  makes it an effective tool for initial reconnaissance and
  vulnerability assessment in web application security testing.
