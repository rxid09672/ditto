  A reconnaissance module that performs credential testing against
  HTTP Basic Authentication endpoints. This module conducts brute
  force attacks against web applications and services that use
  Basic Authentication to identify valid username and password
  combinations.

  The module can test individual credentials or perform dictionary-based
  attacks against specified authentication endpoints. It supports both
  HTTP and HTTPS protocols and can target specific directories or
  paths that require authentication. The module includes threading
  capabilities for efficient scanning across multiple targets and
  provides detailed output of successful authentication attempts.

  This technique is particularly effective for discovering weak
  credentials on web applications, administrative interfaces, and
  other web services that use Basic Authentication. The module can
  identify default credentials, weak passwords, and other
  authentication vulnerabilities that could provide unauthorized
  access to sensitive web resources. This makes it an essential
  tool for web application security assessments and penetration
  testing scenarios where credential harvesting is a priority.
