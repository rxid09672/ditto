  A reconnaissance module that tests SQL Server instances for default
  password configurations. This module leverages the SQL Server
  instance name to determine potential default credentials and
  attempts to authenticate using known default password combinations.

  The module can test individual SQL Server instances or perform
  comprehensive checks across all discovered instances in a domain
  environment. It uses the instance name to identify the likely
  default username and then attempts authentication with common
  default passwords associated with that instance type.

  This technique is based on research from PowerUpSQL and provides
  a systematic approach to identifying SQL Server instances with
  weak default configurations. The module is particularly effective
  for discovering SQL Server instances that have not been properly
  secured after installation, as many SQL Server deployments retain
  default credentials that are well-documented and easily exploitable.
  This makes it an essential tool for database security assessments
  and penetration testing scenarios where SQL Server access is a
  priority.
