  Creates and links a malicious Group Policy Object (GPO) that deploys
  an immediate scheduled task to target systems in an Active Directory environment.
  This technique leverages legitimate Group Policy infrastructure to distribute
  and execute payloads across multiple domain-joined systems simultaneously.

  The
  module creates a new GPO or modifies an existing one, adding an immediate task
  that executes as SYSTEM when Group Policy is processed. This provides both privilege
  escalation (SYSTEM context) and widespread lateral movement capability throughout
  the domain.

  This technique requires domain administrator privileges (or equivalent
  GPO creation/modification rights) but is highly effective for establishing persistence
  and moving laterally at scale. It's particularly dangerous because Group Policy
  is trusted infrastructure in most Windows environments.

  Detection requires
  monitoring for GPO creation/modification events, analysis of Group Policy Objects
  for suspicious scheduled tasks, or endpoint monitoring for unexpected scheduled
  task creation via Group Policy processing.
