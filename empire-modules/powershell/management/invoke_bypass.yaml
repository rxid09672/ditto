  A PowerShell module that executes bypass techniques from the Empire
  server to evade detection and monitoring systems. This module
  applies various obfuscation and evasion techniques to PowerShell
  launchers before execution on the target system.

  The module supports multiple bypass techniques including ETW
  bypass, AMSI bypass, and other evasion methods that can be
  combined to create highly obfuscated payloads. These bypasses
  are prepended to the launcher code to ensure the payload can
  execute without triggering security monitoring systems.

  The module also supports optional code obfuscation using
  Invoke-Obfuscation techniques to further hide the malicious
  code from detection mechanisms. This multi-layered approach
  to evasion makes it particularly effective for maintaining
  stealth during post-exploitation activities and avoiding
  detection by advanced security solutions.
