  Kills Windows Event Log Service threads to disable logging and evade
  detection mechanisms. This module targets the Windows Event Log service by terminating
  its worker threads, effectively stopping event logging without disabling the
  service itself.

  Event log manipulation is a critical anti-forensics technique
  that prevents security events from being recorded, making post-incident analysis
  more difficult. By killing the service threads rather than stopping the service,
  the module maintains the appearance of normal system operation while preventing
  new events from being logged.
