  Enables Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) services on a target Windows
  system by modifying multiple registry values and starting required services.
  The module sets "fDenyTSConnections" to 0, configures firewall exceptions,
  and ensures the Terminal Services service is running.

  The module requires
  administrative privileges and creates several detectable artifacts, including
  registry modifications, service state changes, and potentially firewall rule
  adjustments. In monitored environments, these changes may trigger security alerts
  as they modify standard Windows configurations.
