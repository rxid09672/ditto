  Injects and executes PowerShell commands or scripts into the memory
  space of another process on the target system. This technique allows Empire to
  run PowerShell code while masking the execution under a legitimate process, bypassing
  process-based monitoring and potentially evading detection by security products.

  The module uses reflective injection techniques to create a new PowerShell runtime
  environment within the target process, then executes the specified script or
  commands within that isolated environment. This approach avoids spawning powershell.exe,
  which is often monitored by security solutions.
