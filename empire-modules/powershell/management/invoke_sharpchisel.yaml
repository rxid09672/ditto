  Establishes a reverse tunneling capability using SharpChisel, a C#
  implementation of the Chisel tunneling tool. This module creates encrypted tunnels
  between the compromised system and attacker infrastructure, enabling access to
  otherwise unreachable network segments or services.

  The tunnel operates over
  HTTP/HTTPS, allowing traffic to blend with legitimate web traffic and bypass
  many firewall restrictions. SharpChisel supports various tunnel types including
  SOCKS proxies, remote port forwarding, and local port forwarding to adapt to
  different network pivoting requirements.

  This technique is particularly valuable
  for accessing internal services from external positions, bypassing network segmentation,
  or establishing persistent access channels that don't rely on the Empire agent
  itself. The module executes SharpChisel in memory using .NET reflection, avoiding
  disk writes that might trigger file-based detections.

  The encrypted nature
  of the tunnel helps evade deep packet inspection, though sustained connections
  to external servers may be flagged by network monitoring tools tracking long-lived
  sessions.

  - 'This is the Chisel client loaded with reflection. A chisel server needs to be
    started before running this module. Only Chisel server v1.7.2 was tested with
    this module. Chisel server should be started like so: "./chisel server --reverse"'
