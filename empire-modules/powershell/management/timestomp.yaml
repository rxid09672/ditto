  Executes time-stomp functionality by modifying file timestamps (MAC
  attributes) to manipulate forensic artifacts and evade timeline analysis. This
  module allows operators to alter the Modified, Accessed, and Created timestamps
  of files to blend malicious activities with legitimate system operations.

  Time-stomping
  is a critical anti-forensics technique that helps operators avoid detection during
  post-incident analysis. By setting file timestamps to match legitimate system
  files or historical dates, malicious files can appear to be part of normal system
  operations or pre-date the security incident.

  The module can clone timestamps
  from existing files or set custom timestamps, providing flexibility for different
  operational scenarios and forensic evasion requirements.
