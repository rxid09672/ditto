  Creates a new Empire agent running under the context of different user
  credentials using Windows credential delegation. This module allows operators
  to establish additional agents with different permission sets without requiring
  direct access to the target user's session.

  Unlike simple RunAs execution,
  this technique spawns a persistent agent that maintains the alternate user's
  context for all subsequent commands. This is particularly useful for maintaining
  access to resources that require specific user privileges or for pivoting through
  environments with complex permission structures.

  The module leverages Windows
  authentication mechanisms to create a new process with delegated credentials,
  then injects and executes the Empire stager code within that process. This results
  in a new agent check-in to the Empire server under the specified user context.
