  Forces a system restart of the target machine using the native PowerShell
  Restart-Computer cmdlet. This module provides immediate system reboot capability
  for operational requirements, system maintenance, or to clear volatile memory.

  System restarts are often necessary during post-exploitation activities to clear memory
  artifacts, reload system configurations, or ensure persistence mechanisms are
  properly activated. The forced restart bypasses user prompts and application
  blocking, ensuring the reboot occurs immediately.
