  Searches the Microsoft Exchange Global Address List (GAL) for users matching specified criteria such as name, job title, email address, or department. This module enables operators to enumerate users, gather intelligence on organizational structure, and identify potential targets for phishing or lateral movement.

  The module supports multi-attribute searching and multi-threaded operation for efficiency. Results include user details such as display name, email address, job title, and department, providing valuable reconnaissance data for social engineering or privilege escalation.

  Typical use cases include mapping the organization, identifying high-value targets, and preparing for targeted email attacks or internal spear-phishing campaigns.
