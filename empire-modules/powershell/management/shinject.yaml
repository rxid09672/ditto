  Injects Position Independent Code (PIC) shellcode payload into a target
  process using the Invoke-Shellcode technique. This module allows operators to
  execute arbitrary shellcode within the context of an existing process, bypassing
  traditional process creation monitoring.

  Shellcode injection is a sophisticated
  technique that loads and executes machine code directly in memory without creating
  files on disk. This approach helps evade file-based detection mechanisms and
  allows operators to run custom payloads within trusted processes.

  The module
  supports injection into both 32-bit and 64-bit processes, with automatic architecture
  detection. This capability is essential for executing custom tools, establishing
  persistence mechanisms, or running specialized payloads that require direct memory
  execution.
