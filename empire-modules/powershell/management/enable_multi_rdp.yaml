  Patches the Windows Terminal Services service to allow multiple simultaneous
  RDP sessions on systems where this is normally restricted (like Windows desktop
  editions). This module modifies termsrv.dll in memory and adjusts registry settings
  to bypass Microsoft's single-session limitation.

  This technique is particularly
  useful for maintaining persistent access while legitimate users continue to work
  on the system, allowing operators to connect via RDP without disconnecting existing
  user sessions or alerting them to the intrusion. It effectively transforms desktop
  Windows editions to behave like Terminal Server/RDS.

  The module requires administrative
  privileges and involves modifying system files and registry values. These changes
  may be detected by file integrity monitoring or advanced EDR solutions. System
  updates or patches may revert these modifications, requiring reapplication.
