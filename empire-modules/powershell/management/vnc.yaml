  Executes a VNC (Virtual Network Computing) agent in-memory to establish
  remote desktop access to the target system. This module provides graphical user
  interface access without requiring traditional VNC server installation or file
  system artifacts.

  The VNC agent can operate in two modes: bind mode (listening
  on a local port) or reverse mode (connecting back to a specified IP address).
  This flexibility allows operators to work around network restrictions and firewall
  configurations.

  Password authentication is supported to secure the VNC connection,
  and the in-memory execution helps evade detection by traditional endpoint protection
  solutions that monitor for VNC server installations.
