  A privilege escalation module that restores previously backed up
  service binaries to their original locations. This module is part
  of the cleanup process after using service-based privilege escalation
  techniques to restore system integrity and remove evidence of
  compromise.

  The module takes a service name and optional backup path to restore
  the original service executable that was previously replaced or
  modified during privilege escalation operations. This is essential
  for maintaining operational security and ensuring that the target
  system returns to its original state after successful privilege
  escalation.

  This restoration process is critical for maintaining stealth and
  avoiding detection by system administrators or security monitoring
  tools. By restoring the original service binaries, the module helps
  ensure that the privilege escalation activity leaves minimal traces
  and doesn't disrupt normal system functionality.
