  A privilege escalation module that bypasses User Account Control (UAC)
  by exploiting the Windows Features on Demand Helper (FodHelper.exe).
  This technique manipulates registry keys to redirect FodHelper's
  execution flow and execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

  The module modifies registry entries that control how FodHelper.exe
  processes feature installation requests. By hijacking the registry
  path that FodHelper uses to launch its helper processes, the module
  can execute custom code with administrative privileges while bypassing
  UAC prompts.

  This technique is effective because FodHelper.exe is a legitimate
  Windows component that runs with elevated privileges by design,
  making it an attractive target for UAC bypass techniques. The
  registry modifications required are minimal and can be easily
  cleaned up after successful execution.
