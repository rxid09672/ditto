  Exploits CVE-2020-1472 (ZeroLogon) vulnerability in the Netlogon protocol to reset
  domain controller passwords and gain domain administrative privileges. The vulnerability
  allows attackers to set the domain controller's password to a known value, effectively
  gaining control over the domain. This technique can compromise entire Active Directory
  environments and should be used with extreme caution as it may disrupt domain controller
  communication and affect network operations.
