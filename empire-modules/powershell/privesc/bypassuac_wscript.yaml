  A privilege escalation module that bypasses User Account Control (UAC)
  by exploiting a vulnerability in the Windows Script Host (WSH). This
  technique drops a custom wscript.exe executable and manifest into
  the C:\Windows\ directory, then executes VBScript using the modified
  wscript executable to achieve elevated privileges.

  The module creates a custom manifest that modifies the execution
  context of wscript.exe, allowing VBScript code to run with elevated
  privileges without triggering UAC prompts. This technique exploits
  the fact that Windows Script Host components in the Windows directory
  are trusted by the system and can execute with higher privileges.

  This approach is based on research by @enigma0x3 and @harmyj0y, and
  leverages the UAC bypass vulnerability discovered in the Windows
  Script Host. While effective, this technique requires dropping files
  to disk, which may be detected by security monitoring tools.
