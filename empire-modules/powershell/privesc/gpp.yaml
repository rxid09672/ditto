  Extracts plaintext passwords and account information from Group Policy Preferences
  (GPP) to obtain credentials for privilege escalation. GPP allows administrators
  to configure user accounts and passwords across domain systems, but stores these
  credentials in an encrypted format that can be easily decrypted. The module
  searches for GPP files and decrypts stored credentials, which often include
  administrative passwords or service account credentials.
