  A persistence module that maintains access by routinely resolving a specified
  hostname and comparing the result to a trigger IP address. If the resolved
  IP address does not match the expected value, the module initiates a callback
  to the attacker's server.

  This DNS-based trigger mechanism allows for covert, remote activation of a
  backdoor based on external DNS changes, providing a flexible and stealthy
  persistence strategy that can be controlled by the operator. The module
  continuously monitors DNS resolution results and only activates when the
  expected IP address changes.

  The resolver backdoor technique is particularly effective for maintaining
  long-term access as it leverages legitimate DNS resolution processes and
  can be triggered remotely by the operator through DNS manipulation,
  providing a reliable and stealthy persistence mechanism.
