  A privilege escalation module that adds SID history to a user account,
  granting them the security context and permissions of another user or
  group. This technique allows operators to elevate privileges by
  manipulating the Security Identifier history attribute.

  The module uses Mimikatz to add the SID of a target user or group to
  the SID history of another user account. This effectively grants the
  target user all the permissions and access rights associated with
  the SID being added, including domain administrative privileges if
  the SID belongs to a privileged group.

  This technique is only applicable on domain controllers and provides
  a powerful method for privilege escalation and lateral movement.
  The SID history modification persists across password changes and
  can be used to maintain elevated access to domain resources.
