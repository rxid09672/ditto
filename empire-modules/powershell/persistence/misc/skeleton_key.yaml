  A persistence module that implants a skeleton key into the domain controller's
  LSASS memory space, allowing access to any domain account using a universal
  password. This technique creates a backdoor that bypasses normal authentication
  mechanisms and provides persistent access to the entire domain.

  The skeleton key technique modifies the authentication process in memory to
  accept a predefined password ('mimikatz' by default) for any domain account,
  while preserving the original password functionality. This approach is
  particularly effective as it operates entirely in memory and doesn't
  modify the Active Directory database.

  This technique is only applicable on domain controllers and provides
  a powerful persistence mechanism that can survive password changes and
  domain policy updates. The skeleton key remains active until the domain
  controller is restarted or the LSASS process is recycled.
