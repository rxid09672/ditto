  A persistence module that installs a memory-based Security Support Provider
  (SSP) into the LSASS process to log all authentication events. This technique
  provides continuous credential monitoring and logging capabilities without
  requiring persistent file-based components.

  The memssp technique injects a custom SSP directly into LSASS memory space,
  where it can intercept and log all authentication attempts, including
  successful logons, failed attempts, and credential changes. The logged
  information is written to a file at C:\Windows\System32\mimisla.log,
  providing a comprehensive audit trail of authentication activities.

  This approach is particularly effective for credential harvesting and
  monitoring as it operates at the authentication layer and can capture
  credentials in various formats. The memory-based implementation provides
  stealth advantages over traditional file-based SSPs, though it requires
  re-injection after system restarts.
