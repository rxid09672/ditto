  Establishes persistence by creating a scheduled task that runs with
  user privileges to execute a stager or script. This module leverages the Windows
  Task Scheduler to create a reliable persistence mechanism that can trigger on
  various events including daily execution or user idle time.

  User-level scheduled
  task persistence provides moderate stealth as it uses legitimate Windows functionality
  and can be configured with various triggers to blend with normal system activity.
  The module can store the payload in the registry or reference an external file,
  and supports multiple scheduling options for operational flexibility.

  This technique does not require administrative privileges and creates visible scheduled
  task artifacts that can be detected by security monitoring tools.
