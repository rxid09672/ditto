  Searches for trusted documents on the target system that can be leveraged for code
  execution or persistence. Identifies files marked as trusted by Windows, including
  documents from trusted publishers, files in trusted locations, and previously opened
  documents that bypass security warnings. These trusted documents can be used to
  execute malicious code without triggering security alerts or requiring user interaction
  for approval.
