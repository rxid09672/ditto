description: |
  A network reconnaissance module that queries the discretionary
  access control list (DACL) of Active Directory Integrated DNS
  (ADIDNS) nodes or zones within the specified domain. This module
  is part of the PowerMad toolkit and provides critical information
  about DNS security permissions and potential privilege escalation
  opportunities.

  The module can enumerate permissions across different Active
  Directory partitions including DomainDNSZones, ForestDNSZones,
  and System partitions. It provides detailed information about
  access control entries, user and group permissions, and security
  descriptors that could reveal potential DNS-based privilege
  escalation or lateral movement opportunities.

  This technique is particularly effective for identifying weak
  DNS permissions that could allow unauthorized DNS record
  modification, zone manipulation, or DNS-based attacks. The
  gathered intelligence can be used for planning DNS-based
  privilege escalation, understanding DNS security posture, and
  identifying potential attack vectors within the DNS infrastructure.
  Understanding DNS permissions is essential for comprehensive
  Active Directory security assessments.
