  A network reconnaissance module that queries Active Directory
  Integrated DNS (ADIDNS) zones within the specified domain.
  This module is part of the PowerMad toolkit and provides
  essential information about DNS infrastructure and potential
  attack vectors for DNS-based attacks.

  The module can enumerate DNS zones across different Active
  Directory partitions including DomainDNSZones, ForestDNSZones,
  and System partitions. It provides detailed information about
  each zone including zone properties, DNS records, and
  configuration settings that could reveal potential DNS
  hijacking or poisoning opportunities.

  This technique is particularly effective for understanding
  the DNS infrastructure and identifying potential attack
  vectors such as DNS record manipulation, zone transfer
  attempts, or DNS-based lateral movement techniques. The
  gathered intelligence can be used for planning DNS-based
  attacks, understanding network architecture, and identifying
  potential points of compromise within the DNS infrastructure.
