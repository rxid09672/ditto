  A network reconnaissance module that enumerates Service Principal
  Names (SPNs) from Active Directory using LDAP queries. This module
  discovers service accounts and their associated services, providing
  valuable information for Kerberos-based attacks and service
  enumeration.

  The module can search for SPNs by service type, user account, or
  group membership. It supports wildcard searches and can identify
  various service types including SQL Server, Exchange, HTTP, and
  other enterprise services. This information is crucial for
  understanding the service landscape and identifying potential
  targets for Kerberoasting attacks.

  Service Principal Names are essential for Kerberos authentication
  and can reveal service accounts that may have elevated privileges
  or access to sensitive resources. The module provides detailed
  output including service names, user accounts, and service
  locations, making it an essential tool for Active Directory
  reconnaissance and privilege escalation planning.
