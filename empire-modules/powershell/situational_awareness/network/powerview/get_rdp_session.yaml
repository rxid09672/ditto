description: Enumerates active Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) sessions on a target
  system by querying the Terminal Services API to identify users currently connected
  via remote desktop. This module provides detailed session information including
  session IDs, user names, connection states, client IP addresses, and session durations.
  The reconnaissance capability is essential for understanding remote access patterns,
  identifying active administrative sessions, and mapping user presence across the
  network. By leveraging the Terminal Services API (replacing the legacy qwinsta
  command), operators can identify which users are actively working on systems remotely,
  determine session persistence for targeted attacks, and understand the network's
  remote access landscape. This information is crucial for timing attacks, identifying
  high-value targets, and understanding the operational patterns of the target environment.
  Note that administrative privileges are required on the target system to query
  RDP session information.
