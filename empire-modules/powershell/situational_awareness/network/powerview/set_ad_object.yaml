description: Modifies Active Directory object properties by leveraging PowerView's
  Set-DomainObject function to alter user accounts, computer objects, groups, and
  other domain entities. This module provides granular control over AD object attributes,
  supporting property setting, clearing, and XOR operations for advanced manipulation
  scenarios. The module can modify critical user properties such as account settings,
  group memberships, security attributes, and descriptive information. This capability
  is essential for privilege escalation operations, persistence establishment, and
  domain manipulation activities. By modifying AD object properties, operators can
  alter user permissions, change account settings, update group memberships, and
  manipulate security attributes to achieve various operational objectives. The module
  supports multiple modification modes including direct property setting, property
  clearing, and XOR operations for complex attribute manipulation. This functionality
  is crucial for maintaining persistence, escalating privileges, and manipulating
  the domain environment to support ongoing operations. The module includes comprehensive
  filtering options to target specific objects and supports various output formats
  for operational flexibility.
