description: Enumerates Organizational Units (OUs) within an Active Directory domain
  to identify the hierarchical structure, administrative boundaries, and organizational
  layout. This module leverages PowerView's Get-DomainOU function to query the domain's
  OU container and retrieve comprehensive information about all organizational units,
  including their distinguished names, descriptions, creation dates, and Group Policy
  links. The reconnaissance capability is essential for understanding the domain's
  administrative structure, identifying logical groupings of users and computers,
  and mapping the organizational hierarchy. By analyzing OU structures, operators
  can identify potential administrative boundaries, understand delegation patterns,
  and locate specific organizational units that may contain high-value targets. The
  module supports filtering by identity, Group Policy links, and custom LDAP queries
  to focus reconnaissance efforts on specific organizational areas. This information
  is crucial for targeted reconnaissance, understanding administrative control structures,
  and identifying potential privilege escalation opportunities within specific organizational
  contexts.
