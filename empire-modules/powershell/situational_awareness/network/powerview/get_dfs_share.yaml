description: Enumerates Distributed File System (DFS) shares within an Active Directory
  domain to identify fault-tolerant file sharing infrastructure and potential data
  repositories. This module leverages PowerView's Get-DomainDFSshare function to
  query the domain's DFS configuration and retrieve comprehensive information about
  all DFS namespaces, including share names, target paths, referral information,
  and fault-tolerant configurations. The reconnaissance capability is essential for
  understanding the domain's file sharing architecture, identifying centralized data
  repositories, and mapping the distribution of file resources across multiple servers.
  By analyzing DFS shares, operators can identify potential data exfiltration targets,
  understand file sharing patterns, and discover opportunities for lateral movement
  through file access. The module supports filtering by domain and custom search
  bases to focus reconnaissance efforts on specific organizational areas. This information
  is crucial for data collection operations, understanding the domain's file sharing
  landscape, and identifying potential data exfiltration vectors through centralized
  file repositories.
