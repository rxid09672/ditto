description: Enumerates local group membership on target systems to identify users
  with local administrative access, supporting both local and remote queries with
  recursive domain group resolution. This module leverages PowerView's Get-NetLocalGroup
  function to query local group membership information and retrieve comprehensive
  details about local group members, including local users, domain users, and domain
  groups. The reconnaissance capability is essential for understanding local administrative
  access patterns, identifying privilege escalation opportunities, and mapping local
  administrative relationships across the network. By analyzing local group memberships,
  operators can identify users with local administrative access, understand domain
  group inheritance in local contexts, and discover potential lateral movement opportunities
  through local administrative access. The module supports recursive domain group
  resolution to identify all domain users who have local administrative access through
  nested group memberships. This information is crucial for lateral movement planning,
  privilege escalation targeting, and understanding the distribution of administrative
  access across the network.
