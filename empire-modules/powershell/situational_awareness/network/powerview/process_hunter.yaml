description: Performs comprehensive process hunting across multiple domain systems
  by querying remote process lists to identify specific processes or processes owned
  by particular users. This module leverages PowerView's Find-DomainProcess function
  to systematically enumerate running processes across the domain, supporting both
  process name-based hunting and user-based targeting. The module can search for
  specific applications, services, or processes owned by privileged users such as
  Domain Admins, enabling operators to identify high-value targets and understand
  the domain's operational landscape. The reconnaissance capability is essential
  for identifying potential lateral movement opportunities, understanding user activity
  patterns, and mapping the distribution of specific applications or services across
  the network. By combining computer enumeration with process discovery, operators
  can build a comprehensive picture of the domain's computing environment and identify
  systems where target users are actively working or where specific applications
  are running. The module supports advanced filtering options including operating
  system, site membership, and delegation settings to focus reconnaissance efforts
  on relevant systems.
