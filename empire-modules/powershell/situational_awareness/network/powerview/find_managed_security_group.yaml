description: Identifies security groups that have designated managers with the ability
  to add or remove members, revealing delegation relationships and potential privilege
  escalation opportunities through group management capabilities. This module leverages
  PowerView's Get-DomainManagedSecurityGroup function to analyze security group configurations
  and identify groups that have been configured with manager attributes, along with
  determining whether those managers have the necessary permissions to modify group
  membership. The reconnaissance capability is essential for understanding delegation
  patterns, identifying potential privilege escalation opportunities through group
  management, and mapping administrative control relationships within the domain.
  By analyzing managed security groups, operators can identify users with group management
  capabilities, understand delegation relationships, and discover potential attack
  vectors that leverage group management privileges. The module supports filtering
  by domain and custom search bases to focus reconnaissance efforts on specific organizational
  areas. This information is crucial for privilege escalation planning, understanding
  delegation security implications, and identifying potential lateral movement opportunities
  through group management capabilities that may provide access to sensitive resources
  or administrative functions.
