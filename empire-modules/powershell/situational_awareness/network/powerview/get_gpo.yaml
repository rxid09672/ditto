description: Enumerates Group Policy Objects (GPOs) within an Active Directory domain
  to identify policy configurations, security settings, and administrative controls.
  This module leverages PowerView's Get-DomainGPO function to query the domain's
  Group Policy container and retrieve comprehensive information about all GPOs, including
  their display names, GUIDs, creation dates, modification timestamps, and linked
  locations. The module supports filtering by identity, computer-specific policies,
  user-specific policies, and custom LDAP queries to focus reconnaissance efforts
  on specific policy areas. This reconnaissance capability is essential for understanding
  the domain's security posture, identifying potential policy-based attack vectors,
  and mapping administrative control structures. The module can reveal security policies,
  software deployment configurations, user rights assignments, and other domain-wide
  settings that may impact lateral movement and privilege escalation opportunities.
