  A network reconnaissance module that enumerates domain trust
  relationships within the current domain or specified domain.
  This module is part of the PowerView toolkit and provides
  critical information about inter-domain relationships for
  lateral movement and privilege escalation planning.

  The module can discover trust relationships using multiple
  methods including Win32 API calls, .NET methods, and LDAP
  queries. It provides detailed information about each trust
  including trust direction, trust type, trust attributes,
  and the trusted domain information. This includes both
  incoming and outgoing trusts, forest trusts, and external
  domain relationships.

  This technique is essential for understanding the broader
  Active Directory environment as trust relationships define
  how domains can authenticate and authorize users from other
  domains. Understanding the trust landscape is crucial for
  planning cross-domain attacks, identifying potential lateral
  movement paths, and understanding the overall enterprise
  security architecture. The gathered intelligence can be used
  for mapping attack paths across multiple domains and forests.
