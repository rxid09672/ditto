  A comprehensive Active Directory reconnaissance module that queries
  and enumerates computer objects across the domain. This module is
  part of the PowerView toolkit and provides extensive filtering
  capabilities to identify specific computer systems and their
  properties for lateral movement and privilege escalation planning.

  The module supports multiple search criteria including computer
  name, SID, GUID, and distinguished name patterns. It can filter
  for specific computer types such as systems with unconstrained
  delegation, trusted authentication capabilities, specific service
  principal names, operating system versions, and Active Directory
  site membership. This makes it particularly effective for
  identifying high-value targets and understanding the domain's
  computer landscape.

  This technique is essential for Active Directory reconnaissance
  as it provides detailed computer information including operating
  system details, service configurations, network connectivity,
  and security attributes. The gathered intelligence can be used
  for lateral movement planning, privilege escalation targeting,
  and understanding the overall domain infrastructure. The module
  includes ping-based host discovery and advanced LDAP filtering
  options for precise targeting.
