description: Enumerates group membership details within Active Directory to identify
  direct and nested group members, supporting both direct membership queries and
  recursive group expansion. This module leverages PowerView's Get-DomainGroupMember
  function to query group membership information and retrieve comprehensive details
  about group members, including user accounts, computer objects, and nested groups.
  The reconnaissance capability is essential for understanding the domain's group
  structure, identifying privilege escalation opportunities, and mapping administrative
  access relationships. By analyzing group memberships, operators can identify users
  with specific permissions, understand nested group relationships, and discover
  potential privilege escalation paths through group membership inheritance. The
  module supports recursive group expansion using both traditional recursion and
  LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN for efficient nested group discovery. This information
  is crucial for privilege escalation planning, understanding administrative access
  patterns, and identifying high-value targets within specific group contexts.
