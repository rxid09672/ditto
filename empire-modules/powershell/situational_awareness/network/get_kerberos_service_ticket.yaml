  A network reconnaissance module that retrieves Kerberos service
  ticket information from domain controller event logs. This module
  analyzes Windows Security Event ID 4769 to identify service
  ticket requests and associated user and computer information.

  The module can only run on domain controllers where Kerberos
  authentication events are logged. It extracts IP addresses,
  usernames, and service information from service ticket requests,
  providing valuable intelligence about user activity and service
  access patterns across the domain.

  This technique is particularly useful for understanding user
  behavior, identifying which users access specific services,
  and mapping user-to-computer relationships. The information
  gathered can be used for user hunting, lateral movement
  planning, and understanding the overall authentication
  landscape within the Active Directory environment.
