description: |
  A network reconnaissance module that validates username and password
  combinations against target systems using the SMB protocol. This
  module performs authentication testing to identify valid credentials
  that can be used for network access and lateral movement.

  The module supports testing against individual hosts or multiple
  target systems simultaneously. It can validate both local and
  domain account credentials, making it effective for discovering
  weak authentication across Windows environments. The module
  includes support for credential lists and can use stored
  credentials from the Empire credential store.

  This technique is particularly useful for identifying shared
  credentials, default passwords, and weak authentication that
  could provide unauthorized access to network resources. Successful
  credential validation can enable file share access, remote
  administration, and other SMB-based activities. The module
  provides detailed output of authentication results for further
  analysis and planning of subsequent operations.
