  A sophisticated PowerShell module that extracts master key information
  from unlocked KeePass password databases in memory. This module leverages
  the KeeThief toolkit to perform in-memory credential harvesting from
  active KeePass processes without requiring the master password.

  The module works by analyzing the memory space of running KeePass
  processes to locate and extract the master key components used to
  decrypt the password database. This technique bypasses the need for
  the master password by targeting the decrypted key material that
  remains in memory while KeePass is running.

  This attack vector is particularly effective because it targets
  users who have already unlocked their KeePass database, allowing
  for immediate access to all stored credentials without additional
  authentication. The extracted master key information can be used
  to decrypt the entire password database and access sensitive
  credentials, passwords, and other stored secrets.
