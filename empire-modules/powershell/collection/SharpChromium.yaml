  Extracts sensitive browser data including cookies, browsing history, and saved login
  credentials from Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Microsoft Edge Beta browsers.
  The module leverages the SharpChromium library to decrypt and parse browser databases
  that store user authentication data, session information, and browsing patterns.
  Supports selective data extraction by type (all, logins, history, cookies) and domain
  filtering for targeted credential harvesting. The extracted data includes encrypted
  passwords, session cookies, autofill data, and browsing history with timestamps.
