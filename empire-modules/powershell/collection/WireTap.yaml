  Comprehensive hardware surveillance tool that consolidates multiple surveillance functions
  into a single .NET 4.0 application. The module can capture screenshots (both display and
  webcam), record audio from microphone and system speakers, perform keylogging, and
  activate voice recording when specific keywords are detected. Uses Windows API calls
  and DirectX components to interact with hardware devices directly. Supports configurable
  recording durations, keyword-triggered audio capture, and real-time keystroke monitoring.
  The tool operates at the system level to bypass application-level restrictions and can
  capture sensitive information including passwords, conversations, and visual data.
