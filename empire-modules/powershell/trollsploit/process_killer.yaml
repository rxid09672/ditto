description: Continuously monitors the target system for processes matching a specified
  name and immediately terminates them upon detection, effectively preventing targeted
  applications from running. This module leverages PowerShell to watch for process
  creation events and forcefully kills any process whose name matches the provided
  pattern, supporting wildcards for broad targeting. The technique is useful for
  pranks, psychological operations, or disruptive demonstrations, as it can frustrate
  users by making specific programs impossible to launch. Operators can use this
  module to block games, productivity tools, or any application of interest, with
  optional silent operation to avoid alerting the user. No administrative privileges
  are required, making it effective in a wide range of environments. Use responsibly,
  as repeated process termination can disrupt user productivity and may result in
  data loss if critical applications are targeted.
