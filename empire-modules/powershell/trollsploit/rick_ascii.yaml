description: Launches a new PowerShell process on the target system that displays
  an animated ASCII art rendition of Rick Astley, effectively delivering a classic
  "Rickroll" prank in text mode. This module leverages a PowerShell-encoded command
  to spawn a maximized console window and play the ASCII animation, surprising and
  amusing the user. The technique is intended for humorous psychological operations,
  red team morale-boosting, or lighthearted demonstrations, and is non-destructive
  in nature. The prank is instantly recognizable and can be used to inject levity
  into engagements or to test user awareness. No administrative privileges are required,
  and the prank is harmless, leaving no persistent changes on the system. Use responsibly
  and with consideration for the target audience.
