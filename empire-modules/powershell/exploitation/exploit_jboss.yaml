  Exploits vulnerable JBoss Application Server services to deploy malicious
  WAR files and achieve remote code execution. Targets JBoss instances with
  exposed management interfaces including JMX Console and Web Console.
  Supports deployment of custom WAR files containing malicious payloads
  that can execute arbitrary code on the target system. Can exploit both
  HTTP and HTTPS endpoints and supports various JBoss service configurations.
  Essential for initial access and command execution on vulnerable JBoss
  application servers.
