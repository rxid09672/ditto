  Performs SpoolSample attack using C# binary reflection to exploit Windows
  Print Spooler service for NTLM relay attacks. Forces a target system to
  authenticate to a specified capture server by sending MS-RPRN (Print System
  Remote Protocol) requests. The target system will attempt to authenticate
  to the capture server, allowing for NTLM hash capture and potential relay
  attacks.
