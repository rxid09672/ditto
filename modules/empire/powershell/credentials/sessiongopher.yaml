  Extracts saved sessions and passwords from various remote access and file transfer
  applications including WinSCP, PuTTY, SuperPuTTY, FileZilla, and RDP connections.
  Searches for stored credentials in registry keys, configuration files, and
  saved session files (.ppk, .rdp, .sdtid). Can perform thorough filesystem searches
  and target multiple systems across a domain using WMI. Extracts both cleartext
  and encrypted credentials that users have saved for convenience.
