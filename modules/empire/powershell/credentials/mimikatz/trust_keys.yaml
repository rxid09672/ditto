  Extracts domain trust keys from a domain controller using Mimikatz's lsadump::trust
  or sekurlsa::trust functionality. Domain trust keys are used to establish trust
  relationships between domains and can be used to forge inter-domain authentication
  tickets. Extracts trust keys that can be used for cross-domain attacks and lateral
  movement between trusted domains.
