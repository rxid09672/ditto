  Creates and injects a Silver Ticket into memory using Mimikatz's kerberos::golden
  functionality. Silver Tickets are forged Kerberos service tickets that provide
  access to specific services on target machines. Requires the target machine's
  NTLM hash and domain SID to forge service tickets that impersonate any user
  for specific services (CIFS, HOST, etc.). The forged ticket is injected into
  the current session's Kerberos cache, allowing access to the specified service
  without requiring additional authentication.
