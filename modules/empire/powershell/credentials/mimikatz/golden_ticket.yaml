  Creates and injects a Golden Ticket into memory using Mimikatz's kerberos::golden
  functionality. Golden Tickets are forged Kerberos TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket)
  that provide unlimited access to domain resources. Requires the krbtgt account
  hash and domain SID to forge tickets that impersonate any user with any group
  memberships. The forged ticket is injected into the current session's Kerberos
  cache, allowing access to any service in the domain without requiring additional
  authentication.
