description: Uses the Windows speech synthesis engine to read aloud custom text on
  the target system, surprising or amusing the user with unexpected spoken messages.
  This module leverages PowerShell to invoke the built-in text-to-speech functionality,
  allowing operators to deliver any message in a synthesized voice. The technique
  is intended for psychological operations, red team morale-boosting, or lighthearted
  pranks, and is non-destructive in nature. Spoken messages can be used to startle,
  inform, or entertain users, and the effect is immediate and attention-grabbing.
  No administrative privileges are required, and the prank is harmless, leaving no
  persistent changes on the system. Use responsibly and with consideration for the
  target audience.
