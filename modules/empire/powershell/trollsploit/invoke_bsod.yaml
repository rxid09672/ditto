description: Forces the target Windows system to immediately crash and display a
  Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), simulating a critical system failure as a prank or
  disruptive action. This module leverages PowerShell techniques to trigger a system
  crash without requiring administrative privileges, making it effective even in
  restricted environments. In addition to inducing a BSOD, the module enumerates
  the system's crash dump settings to provide insight into post-crash forensic capabilities.
  This tool is intended for psychological operations, red team demonstrations, or
  humorous scenarios where a dramatic system interruption is desired. Operators should
  be aware that forcibly crashing a system can result in data loss, user disruption,
  and potential forensic artifacts. Use with caution and only in controlled environments
  or with explicit authorization.
