  Executes a command or launches a process under the context of specified
  user credentials without requiring an interactive logon. This module leverages
  Windows API functionality to start a process as another user, optionally using
  the LOGON_NETCREDENTIALS_ONLY flag to provide network-only credentials (similar
  to "runas.exe /netonly").

  This technique is useful for accessing network resources,
  running commands with alternate permissions, or performing actions as a different
  user without fully logging into their session. It is commonly used for lateral
  movement, privilege separation, and operational flexibility in post-exploitation
  scenarios.

  The module supports specifying domain, username, and password, and
  can execute any command or application with the provided credentials. The NetOnly
  option allows the process to use the supplied credentials for network authentication
  while retaining the local user's context.
