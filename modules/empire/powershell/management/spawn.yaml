  Spawns a new Empire agent in a fresh PowerShell process, creating a
  separate communication channel and execution environment. This module allows
  operators to create additional persistence points and maintain multiple concurrent
  connections to the target system.

  The spawned agent runs in a new powershell.exe
  process, providing isolation from the parent agent and reducing the risk of detection
  through process monitoring. This technique is useful for maintaining access when
  the original agent may be compromised or when additional stealth is required.

  The module supports various stager languages (PowerShell, C#, IronPython) and includes
  options for obfuscation and bypass techniques to evade detection.
