  Executes arbitrary DLLs in memory using reflective injection techniques
  without touching the disk or using the standard Windows loader. This module allows
  operators to load and execute compiled tools directly into process memory, bypassing
  file-based detection mechanisms.

  Reflective injection works by implementing
  a custom PE loader that handles memory allocation, imports resolution, and relocation
  fixing, enabling a DLL to load itself into memory from a raw byte array rather
  than from disk. This allows sophisticated post-exploitation tools to run without
  creating filesystem artifacts.

  The module supports injecting into the current
  process or a remote process, allowing operators to hide malicious activity under
  legitimate processes. It can execute both custom and standard DLLs with export
  functions.
