  A module that downgrades domain account security by enabling reversible
  encryption and forcing a password reset on the next user login. This
  technique weakens the security posture of targeted accounts to facilitate
  credential harvesting and privilege escalation.

  The module modifies domain account properties to enable reversible
  encryption, which stores passwords in a less secure format that can
  be more easily extracted by credential harvesting tools. Additionally,
  it forces the account to require a password change on next login,
  potentially capturing the new password through various means.

  This technique is particularly effective for compromising high-value
  accounts as it reduces their security protections and creates
  opportunities for credential harvesting. The module includes repair
  functionality to restore account security settings when needed.
