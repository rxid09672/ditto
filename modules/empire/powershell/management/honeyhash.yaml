  A defensive module that injects artificial credentials into the Local Security
  Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory space to create honeypot credentials
  that can be used to detect credential harvesting attempts. This module helps
  identify when attackers are attempting to extract credentials from memory.

  The module creates fake domain credentials and injects them into LSASS memory,
  where they will be visible to credential harvesting tools like Mimikatz. When
  attackers attempt to extract credentials, these fake credentials will appear
  alongside legitimate ones, providing an early warning system for credential
  harvesting activities.
