  Executes commands or programs with alternate user credentials on the
  target system using the Windows RunAs functionality. This module allows operators
  to run processes under different user contexts without requiring a full login
  session, useful for accessing resources restricted to specific users.

  Unlike
  traditional privilege escalation, RunAs requires knowledge of valid credentials
  but can provide access to network resources, applications, or data that may be
  inaccessible to the current user context. The module supports executing both
  simple commands and full applications with command-line arguments.

  The module
  creates visible process creation events that include the alternate user context,
  potentially alerting security monitoring systems to credential usage patterns.
  The spawned process also operates with standard Windows authentication tokens
  rather than trying to hide its identity.
