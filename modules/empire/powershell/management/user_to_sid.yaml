  Converts a specified domain\\username to its corresponding Security
  Identifier (SID). This module performs user account enumeration and identity
  resolution by translating human-readable usernames into their unique Windows
  security identifiers.

  SIDs are fundamental to Windows security architecture
  and are used throughout the operating system for access control, group membership,
  and security auditing. This conversion is essential for understanding user permissions,
  group memberships, and security relationships within Active Directory environments.

  The module supports both local and domain user accounts, providing operators with
  the ability to map user identities to their underlying security principals for
  reconnaissance and privilege escalation activities.
