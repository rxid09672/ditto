  Searches a specified Outlook folder for items (emails, contacts, tasks, notes, etc.) matching given keywords. This module enables targeted discovery of sensitive or relevant information within a user's mailbox, supporting both broad and highly specific search operations.

  The module supports keyword-based searching, result limits, and multi-threaded operation for efficiency. Results can be output to a file or returned directly for further analysis. This is useful for identifying confidential communications, credentials, or other data of interest during post-exploitation or reconnaissance.

  Typical use cases include searching for passwords, financial data, project information, or other targeted content in user mailboxes.
