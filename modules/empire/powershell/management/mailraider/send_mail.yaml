  Sends emails from the target system using a custom or default template to specified recipients. This module enables operators to automate email delivery for phishing, exfiltration, or internal communication purposes, leveraging the target's Outlook profile and mail infrastructure.

  The module supports specifying individual targets, loading recipient lists from files, customizing email content and subject, attaching files, and using HTML templates. It can also include URLs or payloads for phishing or command and control operations. Emails are sent through the user's legitimate Outlook session, increasing the likelihood of bypassing security controls and user suspicion.

  Typical use cases include spear-phishing, internal phishing campaigns, data exfiltration via email, and establishing covert communication channels.
