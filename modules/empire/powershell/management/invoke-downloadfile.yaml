  A PowerShell module that downloads files from remote sources using
  native PowerShell capabilities. This module provides a clean and
  efficient method for transferring files to compromised systems
  without requiring additional tools or external dependencies.

  The module leverages PowerShell's built-in web request capabilities
  to download files from HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP sources. This approach
  is particularly useful for post-exploitation activities where
  additional tools need to be deployed or when data exfiltration
  requires file transfer capabilities.

  The download functionality supports various file types and can
  handle large files efficiently. This module is essential for
  maintaining operational capabilities by ensuring that necessary
  tools and payloads can be deployed to target systems as needed
  during security assessments and penetration testing operations.
