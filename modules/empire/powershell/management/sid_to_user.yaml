  Converts a specified Security Identifier (SID) to its corresponding
  user account name. This module performs reverse identity resolution by translating
  Windows security identifiers back into human-readable usernames.

  SIDs are
  unique identifiers assigned to security principals in Windows systems, including
  users, groups, and computers. This reverse lookup capability is essential for
  understanding security events, access control entries, and user permissions when
  only SIDs are available in logs or system output.

  The module supports both local
  and domain SIDs, enabling operators to identify user accounts from various sources
  including security logs, registry entries, file permissions, and Active Directory
  objects.
