  Disables Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) services on a target Windows
  system by modifying registry values and stopping related services. This module
  changes the "fDenyTSConnections" registry key to prevent new RDP connections
  and terminates the "TermService" service.

  This technique is useful for limiting
  remote access capabilities after exploitation to prevent other attackers from
  accessing the compromised system or to hinder incident response efforts. It can
  also be used defensively to close potential access vectors.

  The module requires
  administrative privileges on the target system and creates artifacts in Windows
  registry and service control logs. Changes can be reversed by re-enabling RDP
  through another management module.
