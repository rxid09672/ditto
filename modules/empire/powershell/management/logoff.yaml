  Logs off the current user or all users from the target machine. This
  module provides the ability to terminate user sessions, forcing users to log
  off interactively or remotely.

  Logging off users can be useful for operational
  security, clearing active sessions, or preparing a system for further exploitation
  or cleanup. The module supports logging off a single user (the session running
  the agent) or all users currently logged into the system.

  This capability
  is often used to disrupt user activity, clear evidence, or ensure that only authorized
  sessions remain active during post-exploitation operations.
