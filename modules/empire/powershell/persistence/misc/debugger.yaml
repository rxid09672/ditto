  A persistence module that establishes system-level persistence by hijacking
  the Windows debugger registry key to execute an Empire stager whenever
  a specified application is launched. This approach leverages Windows
  debugging infrastructure to create a stealthy persistence mechanism
  that triggers on application execution.

  The module modifies the AeDebug registry key to specify a custom debugger
  that will be invoked whenever the target application crashes or is
  launched with debugging enabled. This technique is particularly effective
  as it uses legitimate Windows debugging functionality and can be
  configured to target commonly used applications.

  Debugger hijacking persistence provides excellent stealth as it leverages
  native Windows functionality and operates under the guise of legitimate
  debugging activities. However, it requires administrative privileges
  and creates registry artifacts that can be detected by advanced
  security monitoring tools.
