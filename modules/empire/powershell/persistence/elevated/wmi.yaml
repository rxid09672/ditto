  Establishes persistence using a permanent WMI event subscription that
  executes a stager or script when specific system events occur. This module creates
  a sophisticated persistence mechanism that leverages Windows Management Instrumentation
  to trigger execution based on various system events such as process creation,
  logon events, or scheduled times.

  WMI-based persistence uses legitimate Windows
  management infrastructure and can be configured to trigger on common system events,
  making detection more difficult. The module supports multiple trigger types including
  daily execution, specific days of the week/month, and failed logon attempts,
  providing operational flexibility while maintaining stealth.

  This technique requires administrative privileges and creates WMI artifacts that can be detected
  by advanced security monitoring tools.
