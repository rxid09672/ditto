  Modifies the Relative Identifier (RID) of an existing user account
  to grant it administrative privileges by changing the RID value used to create
  access tokens. This technique allows operators to elevate a regular user account
  to have the same privileges as the built-in Administrator account (RID 500) without
  modifying group memberships.

  RID hijacking is a sophisticated privilege escalation
  technique that works by directly modifying the SAM database to change how Windows
  interprets user privileges. This approach bypasses traditional group-based access
  control and can be used to create hidden administrative accounts that appear
  as regular users to most security tools.

  This technique requires administrative
  privileges to implement and creates persistent privilege escalation that survives
  reboots and password changes.
