  A persistence module that creates a new shortcut (.LNK) file on a targeted
  user's desktop, backdoored to launch both a legitimate application and
  an Empire stager. This approach enables the operator to maintain access
  by enticing the user to execute the shortcut, which appears useful or familiar.

  The module allows customization of the shortcut's name, icon, and target
  application, increasing the likelihood of user interaction and successful
  agent deployment. By creating a new shortcut rather than modifying existing
  ones, the module provides a clean persistence mechanism that doesn't
  interfere with normal user workflows.

  This phishing technique is particularly effective for maintaining access
  as it leverages social engineering principles and user behavior patterns,
  providing a reliable method for re-establishing connections through
  user-initiated actions.
