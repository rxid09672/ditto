  A persistence module that establishes a backup backdoor by monitoring for the
  presence of a specified user account on the target system. If the designated
  user account is not found, the module initiates a callback to the attacker's
  server, enabling re-establishment of access.

  This approach provides a resilient persistence mechanism that can automatically
  trigger a new connection if the primary backdoor user is removed, ensuring
  continued access even after partial remediation by defenders. The module
  continuously monitors for the specified user account and maintains stealth
  by only activating when the account is absent.

  The dead user backdoor technique is particularly effective for maintaining
  long-term access in environments where user accounts may be periodically
  cleaned up or removed by security teams, providing a reliable fallback
  mechanism for persistence.
