  Exploits CVE-2020-1048 (PrintDemon) vulnerability in Windows Print Spooler to
  achieve privilege escalation and persistence. The vulnerability allows unprivileged
  users to gain SYSTEM-level privileges by exploiting the print spooler service.
  Creates a malicious DLL (ualapi.dll) that gets loaded into System32 and establishes
  persistence through registry modifications that execute code as SYSTEM on system
  restart. The technique leverages Windows print spooler architecture to achieve
  both privilege escalation and persistent access to the target system.
