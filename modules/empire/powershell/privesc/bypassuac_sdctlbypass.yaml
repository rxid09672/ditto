  A privilege escalation module that bypasses User Account Control (UAC)
  by exploiting the Windows System Data Collection Tool (sdclt.exe).
  This technique manipulates registry entries to redirect sdclt's
  execution flow and execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

  The module modifies registry keys that control how sdclt.exe processes
  system data collection requests. By hijacking the registry path that
  sdclt uses to launch its helper processes, the module can execute
  custom code with administrative privileges while bypassing UAC prompts.

  This technique is based on research by @enigma0x3 and leverages the
  fact that sdclt.exe is a legitimate Windows component that runs with
  elevated privileges by design. The registry modifications required
  are minimal and can be easily cleaned up after successful execution,
  making this a relatively stealthy UAC bypass method.
