  Exploits MS16-135 vulnerability to spawn a new listener with SYSTEM privileges.
  The vulnerability exploits a kernel-level race condition in Windows to elevate
  privileges from a standard user to SYSTEM. Limited to x64 systems and requires
  an unlocked user session. The exploit performs rapid window switching which may
  cause visible desktop flashing and creates named pipes, making it less stealthy
  than other privilege escalation methods.
