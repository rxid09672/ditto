  A privilege escalation module that performs service binary replacement
  to achieve elevated privileges. This technique backs up the original
  service executable and replaces it with a malicious binary that
  launches a stager to establish a privileged connection.

  The module identifies vulnerable services and creates a backup of
  the original service binary before replacing it with a custom
  executable. The replacement binary is designed to launch a stager
  that connects back to the Empire server with elevated privileges,
  while maintaining the appearance of normal service functionality.

  This technique is particularly effective because services often
  run with elevated privileges, providing an immediate path to
  administrative access. The module includes options for self-deletion
  of the launcher file and obfuscation to maintain operational
  security. This approach is based on the PowerUp toolkit and
  represents a sophisticated method of service-based privilege escalation.
