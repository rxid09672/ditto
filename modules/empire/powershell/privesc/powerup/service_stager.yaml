  A privilege escalation module that abuses Windows services to execute
  an Empire stager with elevated privileges. This technique modifies
  the configuration of a target service to launch a malicious payload
  when the service starts or restarts.

  The module identifies vulnerable services and modifies their
  configuration to include the execution of an Empire stager. This
  can be achieved by modifying the service's binary path, command
  line parameters, or other configuration options that control how
  the service executes.

  This technique is particularly effective because services often
  run with elevated privileges, providing an immediate path to
  administrative access. The module can trigger the service to
  restart immediately or wait for the next system restart, depending
  on operational requirements. This approach is based on the PowerUp
  toolkit and represents a sophisticated method of service-based
  privilege escalation that can provide persistent access.
