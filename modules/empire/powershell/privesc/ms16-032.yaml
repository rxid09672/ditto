  Exploits MS16-032 vulnerability to spawn a new listener with SYSTEM privileges.
  The vulnerability exploits a race condition in Windows secondary logon service
  to elevate privileges from a standard user to SYSTEM. Leverages thread handle
  manipulation to bypass security controls and execute arbitrary code with the
  highest privileges. Note that the exploit has a success rate of approximately
  5/6 attempts and may require retry if unsuccessful.
