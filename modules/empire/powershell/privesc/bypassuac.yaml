  Performs User Account Control (UAC) bypass to escape from medium integrity processes
  to high integrity processes without triggering UAC prompts. Leverages Windows
  elevation mechanisms and DLL injection techniques to bypass security controls
  and gain elevated privileges. The technique exploits Windows elevation policies
  and process creation mechanisms to execute code with administrative privileges
  while avoiding detection by UAC monitoring systems.
