  Exploits CVE-2021-1675 (PrintNightmare) vulnerability in Windows Print Spooler
  to achieve privilege escalation and create administrative accounts. The vulnerability
  allows unprivileged users to add malicious printer drivers that execute arbitrary
  code with SYSTEM privileges. Can create new local administrator accounts with
  known credentials or execute custom DLL payloads for more sophisticated attacks.
  The technique exploits the Windows print spooler service to bypass security
  controls and gain elevated privileges on the target system.
