  Executes commands or Empire stagers on remote hosts using Distributed
  Component Object Model (DCOM) for lateral movement. DCOM provides object-oriented
  interfaces that can be remotely executed with appropriate permissions (typically
  admin) without triggering suspicious processes like PsExec. This module supports
  multiple COM application methods including MMC20.Application, ShellWindows, ShellBrowserWindow,
  and ExcelDDE, allowing flexibility to evade detection or adapt to different target
  environments. It's an effective technique for establishing remote access when WMI
  or other methods are monitored but DCOM isn't explicitly blocked.
