  Executes PowerShell commands or Empire stagers on remote hosts using
  Windows PowerShell Remoting (WinRM). This technique leverages the built-in remote
  management functionality of modern Windows systems, which operates over HTTP/HTTPS
  (5985/5986).

  PowerShell Remoting provides a native
  alternative to other lateral movement techniques as it uses legitimate administration
  channels that may be expected in enterprise environments. The module requires
  administrative credentials on the target and that PowerShell Remoting is enabled
  (default on server installations since Windows Server 2012).

  The module supports
  both interactive sessions and one-time command execution. PowerShell Remoting
  traffic is encrypted by default, providing additional security for command and
  output transmission, but may be subject to detection through PowerShell logging,
  ETW, or network traffic analysis if specifically monitored.
