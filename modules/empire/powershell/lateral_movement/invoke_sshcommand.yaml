  Executes commands on remote Linux/Unix systems over SSH using provided
  credentials or key-based authentication. This module allows operators to run
  arbitrary commands or Empire stagers on SSH-enabled hosts, making it especially
  useful for lateral movement in mixed Windows/Linux environments.

  The module
  supports both password-based and key-based authentication methods and can execute
  either single commands or transfer and execute more complex scripts. It operates
  over standard SSH ports (typically 22/TCP) and handles command output retrieval.

  SSH
  command execution is generally less suspicious than many Windows lateral movement
  techniques as it uses legitimate administrative channels. However, SSH access
  may be logged by security monitoring systems, and failed authentication attempts
  can trigger lockouts or alerts.
