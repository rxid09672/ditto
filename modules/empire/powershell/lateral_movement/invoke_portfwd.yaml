  Creates a dynamic port forwarding tunnel using the SSH protocol, allowing
  traffic to be redirected through an intermediary host to reach otherwise inaccessible
  network segments. This module establishes a SOCKS proxy on the local system that
  routes traffic through the SSH connection to the target.

  This technique is
  particularly useful for pivoting through compromised hosts to access isolated
  network segments, perform internal network reconnaissance, or interact with services
  that are not directly accessible from the operator's position.

  The module requires
  SSH credentials or key-based authentication to the intermediary host. Once established,
  other tools can be configured to use the SOCKS proxy, effectively extending their
  reach into previously inaccessible network areas without requiring direct network
  connectivity.
