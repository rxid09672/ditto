  Executes PowerShell commands or Empire stagers on remote systems using
  Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). WMI offers a stealthier alternative
  to other lateral movement techniques like PsExec, as it doesn't require creating
  a service on the target machine.

  This module leverages the WMI Win32_Process
  class to create processes remotely and supports both plaintext credentials and
  pass-the-hash techniques for authentication. WMI execution typically only requires
  administrative privileges on the target and operates over standard DCOM/RPC ports
  (typically 135/TCP), making it effective even in environments with limited outbound
  connectivity.

  While WMI execution is more subtle than service-based techniques,
  modern EDR solutions often monitor WMI activity for process creation events.
  This technique leaves artifacts in WMI event logs and process creation logs that
  can be detected by security monitoring systems specifically watching for this
  attack vector.
