  Executes commands or Empire stagers on remote systems using the SMBExec
  technique, a lateral movement method that creates and leverages a service on
  the target system similar to PsExec but with some OPSEC improvements.

  Unlike
  traditional PsExec, SMBExec avoids writing the payload to disk by leveraging command
  output redirection through SMB named pipes. It creates a Windows service that
  executes the command and redirects output over SMB back to the attacker, then removes
  the service to clean up evidence.

  This technique requires administrative credentials
  (or equivalent) on the target system and functions over standard SMB ports (445/TCP).
  It supports both plaintext credentials and NTLM hashes for authentication via
  pass-the-hash techniques.

  While more stealthy than traditional PsExec, SMBExec
  still generates Windows service creation events and may be detected by security
  monitoring focused on service creation patterns and suspicious command execution.
