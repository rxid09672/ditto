  PowerShell module that leverages PowerSploit to generate full-memory minidumps of
  target processes using Windows' native MiniDumpWriteDump API. Creates comprehensive
  process memory dumps containing all process memory, similar to procdump.exe with
  the '-ma' switch. Supports dumping by process name or process ID, with configurable
  output paths. Essential for memory forensics, credential extraction from LSASS,
  and process analysis. Requires elevated privileges for dumping system processes
  or processes from other users.
