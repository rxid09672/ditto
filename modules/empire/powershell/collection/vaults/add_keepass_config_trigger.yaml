  A PowerShell module that installs persistent exfiltration triggers
  into KeePass configuration files to enable automatic credential
  harvesting. This module is part of the KeeThief toolkit designed
  for long-term access to password manager contents.

  The module first terminates any running KeePass processes to ensure
  configuration files can be modified, then adds custom triggers that
  automatically export database contents or copy data when specific
  conditions are met. These triggers can be configured to export
  entire databases or capture data that users copy from KeePass,
  providing persistent access to stored credentials.

  This persistence mechanism is particularly effective because it
  leverages KeePass's legitimate trigger functionality to perform
  malicious exfiltration. The triggers can be configured to execute
  when databases are opened, when data is copied, or based on other
  user actions, ensuring continuous access to sensitive information
  without requiring ongoing operator interaction.
