  Captures and logs keystrokes, active window titles, and timestamps
  on the target system. The keystrokes are stored in a file named `keystrokes.txt`
  within the path `Empire/downloads/<AgentName>/`. This module can be used to collect
  sensitive input such as passwords, messages, or command-line usage over time. It
  supports optional sleep delay between key reads to reduce CPU usage. This technique is often used for credential access, user monitoring,
  or activity logging during post-exploitation.
