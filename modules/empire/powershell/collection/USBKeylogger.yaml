  Captures keystrokes in real-time using Windows API calls to monitor user input across
  all applications. The module uses GetAsyncKeyState and related Windows functions to
  detect key presses, including special keys like Shift, Ctrl, Alt, arrow keys, and
  function keys. Captures the active window title when it changes, providing context
  for the keystrokes being logged. Supports configurable polling intervals to balance
  between responsiveness and system performance. The keylogger runs as a background
  process and can capture credentials, sensitive data, and user behavior patterns.
