  Initiates network packet capture using Windows' built-in netsh trace functionality. This module
  leverages the Windows Network Diagnostics Framework to capture network traffic at the system level,
  generating Event Trace Log (ETL) files that can be analyzed with tools like Network Monitor or
  converted to PCAP format. The capture operates at the network interface level, capturing all
  packets traversing the system including TCP, UDP, and other protocols. Supports configurable
  file size limits, persistent captures that survive system reboots, and can be stopped remotely.
  Useful for network reconnaissance, traffic analysis, and monitoring network communications
  between systems. The ETL format provides detailed packet information including timestamps,
  protocol headers, and payload data. Requires administrative privileges to access network
  diagnostic capabilities.
