  Enumerates access control lists (ACLs) for specified file system paths to understand
  permission structures and identify potential privilege escalation opportunities.
  Analyzes both discretionary (DACL) and system (SACL) access control lists, showing
  user and group permissions, inheritance settings, and audit policies. Useful for
  identifying misconfigured permissions, understanding security boundaries, and finding
  paths where the current user has elevated access. Essential for privilege escalation
  planning and understanding the security posture of critical system directories and files.software: ''
