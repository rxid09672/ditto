  Enumerates proxy server configuration and settings on the target system to understand
  network communication patterns and potential exfiltration channels. Queries both
  system-wide and user-specific proxy settings, including proxy server addresses,
  authentication requirements, and bypass lists. Provides insight into network architecture,
  potential proxy-based attacks, and communication channels that may be monitored or
  restricted. Information gathered includes proxy server URLs, authentication methods,
  and domains that bypass proxy settings.
