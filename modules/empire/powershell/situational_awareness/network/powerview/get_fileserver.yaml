description: Discovers file servers within an Active Directory domain by analyzing
  user account attributes including home directories, script paths, and profile paths
  to identify centralized file storage infrastructure. This module leverages PowerView's
  Get-DomainFileServer function to query user account attributes and extract file
  server information from various path fields, providing comprehensive visibility
  into the domain's file storage architecture. The reconnaissance capability is essential
  for understanding the domain's file sharing infrastructure, identifying centralized
  data repositories, and mapping the distribution of user data across file servers.
  By analyzing file server information, operators can identify potential data exfiltration
  targets, understand user data storage patterns, and discover opportunities for
  lateral movement through file access. The module supports filtering by domain and
  custom LDAP queries to focus reconnaissance efforts on specific organizational
  areas. This information is crucial for data collection operations, understanding
  the domain's file storage landscape, and identifying potential data exfiltration
  vectors through centralized file repositories that may contain sensitive user data.
