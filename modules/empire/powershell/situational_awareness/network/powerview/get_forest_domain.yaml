description: Enumerates all domains within an Active Directory forest to identify
  the complete domain hierarchy and forest structure. This module leverages PowerView's
  Get-ForestDomain function to query forest-level domain information and retrieve
  comprehensive details about all domains within the forest, including domain names,
  SIDs, functional levels, and domain relationships. The reconnaissance capability
  is essential for understanding the complete scope of the Active Directory environment,
  identifying all potential target domains, and mapping the forest's domain hierarchy.
  By analyzing forest domain information, operators can identify child domains, understand
  domain relationships, and determine the full scope of potential lateral movement
  opportunities across the forest. This information is crucial for enterprise-wide
  reconnaissance, cross-domain attack planning, and understanding the complete Active
  Directory topology. The module provides foundational information about the forest's
  domain structure that is essential for comprehensive Active Directory reconnaissance
  and multi-domain operations.
