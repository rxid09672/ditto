  A sophisticated Active Directory reconnaissance module that identifies
  which machines specific users or user groups are currently logged
  into across the domain. This module is part of the PowerView toolkit
  and provides critical intelligence for user hunting and lateral
  movement planning.

  The module can target specific users, user groups, or use LDAP
  filters to identify target users based on various criteria such
  as administrative privileges, delegation settings, or group
  memberships. It then enumerates active sessions across domain
  computers to locate where these users are currently logged in,
  providing real-time intelligence about user activity.

  This technique is particularly effective for identifying high-value
  targets and understanding user behavior patterns. The module includes
  stealth options to minimize detection, threading capabilities for
  efficient enumeration, and access checking to identify systems
  where the current user has administrative privileges. This gathered
  intelligence is essential for planning targeted attacks, lateral
  movement strategies, and understanding the overall user landscape
  within the Active Directory environment.
