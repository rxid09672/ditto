description: Extracts and analyzes default domain and domain controller policies
  to identify security configurations, password policies, account lockout settings,
  and other domain-wide security parameters. This module leverages PowerView's Get-DomainPolicyData
  function to query the domain's default security policies and retrieve comprehensive
  information about domain-wide security settings, including password complexity
  requirements, account lockout thresholds, Kerberos policy settings, and audit configurations.
  The reconnaissance capability is essential for understanding the domain's security
  posture, identifying potential policy-based attack vectors, and mapping the domain's
  security configuration. By analyzing domain policies, operators can identify weak
  password policies, understand account lockout mechanisms, and discover potential
  privilege escalation opportunities through policy misconfigurations. The module
  supports extraction of both domain and domain controller policies to provide a
  complete picture of the domain's security configuration. This information is crucial
  for understanding the domain's security model, identifying potential policy-based
  vulnerabilities, and planning attacks that leverage policy weaknesses.
