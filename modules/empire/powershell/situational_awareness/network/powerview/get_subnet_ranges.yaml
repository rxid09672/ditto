description: Performs comprehensive network range discovery by extracting hostnames
  from Active Directory, conducting reverse DNS lookups, and analyzing the results
  to identify network subnet ranges and IP address distributions. This module leverages
  PowerView to query AD computer objects and then performs reverse DNS resolution
  to map hostnames to IP addresses, subsequently parsing the results into logical
  network ranges. The reconnaissance capability is essential for understanding the
  network's IP addressing scheme, identifying network segments, and mapping the distribution
  of systems across different subnet ranges. By analyzing the IP address distribution,
  operators can identify potential network-based attack vectors, understand the network
  topology, and plan targeted reconnaissance within specific IP ranges. The module
  supports both individual IP listing and range-based output to provide flexibility
  in network analysis. This information is crucial for network reconnaissance, understanding
  the IP addressing architecture, and identifying potential network-based lateral
  movement opportunities within specific subnet ranges.
