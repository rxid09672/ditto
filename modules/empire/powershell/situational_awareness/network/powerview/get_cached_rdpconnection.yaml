description: Enumerates cached Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connection information
  from the Windows registry to identify historical remote access patterns and potential
  lateral movement targets. This module leverages PowerView's Get-WMIRegCachedRDPConnection
  function to query the Windows Remote Desktop Connection Client registry entries
  and retrieve comprehensive information about cached RDP connections, including
  target servers, connection timestamps, and user credentials. The reconnaissance
  capability is essential for understanding remote access patterns, identifying potential
  lateral movement opportunities, and mapping the network's remote access landscape.
  By analyzing cached RDP connections, operators can identify systems that users
  have previously accessed, understand remote access workflows, and discover potential
  targets for lateral movement. The module supports both local and remote registry
  queries to provide visibility into RDP connection history across the network. This
  information is crucial for lateral movement planning, understanding user access
  patterns, and identifying potential privilege escalation opportunities through
  historical remote access relationships.
