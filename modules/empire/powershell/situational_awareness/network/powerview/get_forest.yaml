description: Enumerates Active Directory forest information to identify the forest
  root domain, forest SID, and forest-wide configuration details. This module leverages
  PowerView's Get-Forest function to query forest-level attributes and retrieve comprehensive
  information about the Active Directory forest, including the forest name, root
  domain, forest SID, and forest functional level. The reconnaissance capability
  is essential for understanding the broader Active Directory environment, identifying
  forest boundaries, and mapping the forest's administrative structure. By analyzing
  forest information, operators can identify the forest root domain, understand forest-wide
  security policies, and determine the scope of potential cross-domain operations.
  This information is crucial for enterprise-wide reconnaissance, understanding the
  complete Active Directory topology, and planning operations that may span multiple
  domains within the forest. The module provides foundational information about the
  forest structure that is essential for comprehensive Active Directory reconnaissance
  and cross-domain attack planning.
