description: Enumerates Active Directory subnets to identify network segments, IP
  address ranges, and site associations within the domain. This module leverages
  PowerView's Get-DomainSubnet function to query the domain's subnet container and
  retrieve comprehensive information about all network subnets, including their IP
  address ranges, site associations, descriptions, and location information. The
  reconnaissance capability is essential for understanding the network's IP addressing
  scheme, identifying network segmentation boundaries, and mapping the relationship
  between network subnets and Active Directory sites. By analyzing subnet information,
  operators can identify potential network-based attack vectors, understand the network
  topology, and plan lateral movement strategies that account for network boundaries.
  The module supports filtering by site name and custom LDAP queries to focus reconnaissance
  efforts on specific network areas. This information is crucial for network reconnaissance,
  understanding the IP addressing architecture, and identifying potential network-based
  privilege escalation opportunities within specific subnet ranges.
