description: Enumerates Active Directory sites within a domain to identify the physical
  network topology, geographic distribution, and site-based replication boundaries.
  This module leverages PowerView's Get-DomainSite function to query the domain's
  site container and retrieve comprehensive information about all AD sites, including
  their names, descriptions, site links, and associated subnets. The reconnaissance
  capability is essential for understanding the network's physical layout, identifying
  geographically distributed resources, and mapping site-based administrative boundaries.
  By analyzing site structures, operators can identify potential network segmentation,
  understand replication patterns, and locate systems within specific geographic
  or network locations. The module supports filtering by identity, Group Policy links,
  and custom LDAP queries to focus reconnaissance efforts on specific site areas.
  This information is crucial for understanding the network topology, identifying
  potential network-based attack vectors, and planning lateral movement strategies
  that account for physical network boundaries and site-based security policies.
