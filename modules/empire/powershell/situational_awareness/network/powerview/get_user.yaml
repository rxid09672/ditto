  A comprehensive Active Directory reconnaissance module that queries
  and enumerates user accounts across the domain. This module is
  part of the PowerView toolkit and provides extensive filtering
  and search capabilities to identify specific user accounts and
  their properties.

  The module supports multiple search criteria including username,
  SID, GUID, and distinguished name patterns. It can filter for
  specific user types such as service accounts with SPNs, privileged
  accounts with adminCount=1, accounts with delegation settings,
  and users with specific Kerberos configurations. This makes it
  particularly effective for identifying high-value targets and
  understanding the domain's user landscape.

  This technique is essential for Active Directory reconnaissance
  as it provides detailed user information including group memberships,
  account settings, last logon times, and security attributes. The
  gathered intelligence can be used for privilege escalation planning,
  lateral movement targeting, and understanding the overall domain
  security posture. The module includes advanced LDAP filtering
  options for precise targeting and comprehensive output formatting.
