  A sophisticated Active Directory reconnaissance module that identifies
  machines across the domain where the current user has local
  administrator privileges. This module is part of the PowerView
  toolkit and provides critical intelligence for lateral movement
  and privilege escalation planning.

  The module can target specific computers or use LDAP filters to
  identify target systems based on various criteria such as operating
  system, service pack, site membership, or organizational unit
  location. It then tests the current user's administrative access
  to each target system, providing a comprehensive map of systems
  where lateral movement is possible.

  This technique is particularly effective for understanding the
  scope of administrative access and identifying potential lateral
  movement paths. The module includes options for share access
  checking and can filter results based on specific criteria to
  focus on high-value targets. This gathered intelligence is
  essential for planning lateral movement strategies, privilege
  escalation paths, and understanding the overall administrative
  landscape within the Active Directory environment.
