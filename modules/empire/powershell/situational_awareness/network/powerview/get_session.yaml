description: Enumerates active network sessions on a target system by leveraging
  the NetSessionEnum Win32API call to identify users currently connected to file
  shares, administrative sessions, and other network resources. This module provides
  visibility into active user sessions, including session types, connection times,
  idle durations, and client information. The reconnaissance capability is particularly
  valuable for understanding user activity patterns, identifying potential lateral
  movement opportunities, and mapping user presence across the network. By querying
  session information, operators can identify which users are actively working on
  systems, determine session persistence for targeted attacks, and understand the
  network's current usage patterns. This information is crucial for timing attacks,
  identifying high-value targets, and understanding the operational patterns of the
  target environment.
