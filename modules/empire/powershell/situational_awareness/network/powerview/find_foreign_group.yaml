description: Analyzes group memberships within a domain to identify users from external
  domains who have been granted access to resources, revealing cross-domain trust
  relationships and potential privilege escalation opportunities. This module leverages
  PowerView's Get-DomainForeignGroupMember function to enumerate all group members
  and identify users who belong to domains other than the queried domain. The reconnaissance
  capability is essential for understanding cross-domain access patterns, identifying
  potential lateral movement opportunities across domain boundaries, and mapping
  the broader Active Directory trust relationships. By analyzing foreign group members,
  operators can identify external users with access to domain resources, understand
  trust relationship implications, and discover potential attack vectors that leverage
  cross-domain access. The module supports filtering by domain and custom LDAP queries
  to focus reconnaissance efforts on specific cross-domain relationships. This information
  is crucial for cross-domain reconnaissance, understanding trust relationship security
  implications, and identifying potential privilege escalation opportunities through
  cross-domain group memberships that may provide access to sensitive resources.
