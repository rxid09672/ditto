  A network reconnaissance module that gathers detailed information
  from SQL Server instances across the network. This module
  connects to target SQL Servers to retrieve server configuration,
  user permissions, database information, and other system details
  that are valuable for database security assessments.

  The module can target individual SQL Server instances or perform
  comprehensive enumeration across all discovered instances in the
  domain. It extracts information including server versions, service
  accounts, database names, user roles, and configuration settings
  that could reveal potential security weaknesses or misconfigurations.

  This technique is particularly effective for understanding the
  SQL Server landscape, identifying privileged service accounts,
  and discovering databases that may contain sensitive information.
  The gathered intelligence can be used for privilege escalation
  planning, data exfiltration targeting, and overall database
  security posture assessment.
