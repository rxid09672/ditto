description: Beacon Object File (BOF) that executes custom Windows Management Instrumentation
  (WMI) queries against local or remote systems and returns results in CSV format.
  Supports flexible querying across different WMI namespaces, allowing for comprehensive
  system enumeration including hardware information, software inventory, configuration
  settings, and security data. Enables targeted reconnaissance by querying specific
  system properties and can be used for both local and remote system discovery.
