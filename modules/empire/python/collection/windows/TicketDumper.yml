  Extracts Kerberos tickets from the Windows LSA (Local Security Authority)
  using IronPython to interface with the Windows API. Leverages the
  LsaEnumerateLogonSessions and LsaGetLogonSessionData functions to
  enumerate active logon sessions and retrieve associated Kerberos
  ticket information. Provides detailed output including ticket
  lifetimes, service names, and authentication data similar to
  the native klist.exe utility. Requires administrative privileges
  to access LSA memory and ticket data. Useful for credential
  harvesting, Kerberos reconnaissance, and understanding active
  authentication sessions on Windows systems.
