  mss module, which leverages ctypes and the CoreFoundation library
  for native screen capture capabilities. Supports capturing from
  specific monitors or all connected displays simultaneously.
  Generates high-quality PNG images that are saved to disk for
  later retrieval. Provides visual reconnaissance capabilities
  for capturing the current state of user desktops, including
  open applications, documents, and user activity. Useful for
  surveillance, intelligence gathering, and understanding user
  behavior through visual analysis of desktop contents.
