  Executes a comprehensive Linux privilege escalation checker written
  in pure Python to enumerate system information and identify common
  privilege escalation vectors. Scans for kernel exploits, misconfigured
  services, weak file permissions, environment variables, and other
  security misconfigurations that could lead to privilege escalation.
  Provides detailed output of potential attack paths and system
  vulnerabilities. Useful for post-exploitation reconnaissance,
  security assessments, and identifying privilege escalation
  opportunities on Linux systems.
