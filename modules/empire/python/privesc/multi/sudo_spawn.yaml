  A privilege escalation module that leverages sudo access to spawn a new Empire agent
  with elevated privileges. This module requires the current user to have sudo privileges
  and knowledge of the user's password to execute commands with root-level permissions.

  The module works by:
  - Using the provided password to authenticate with sudo
  - Downloading and executing the Empire stager with root privileges
  - Establishing a new agent process running as the root user
  - Maintaining the original agent while creating a high-integrity session

  This technique is useful when:
  - The current user has sudo access but the agent is running with limited privileges
  - You need to perform operations that require root-level access
  - You want to establish a persistent high-privilege foothold on the system
  - The target system has sudo configured to require password authentication

  The spawned agent inherits root privileges, allowing access to sensitive system
  files, configuration changes, and administrative operations that would otherwise
  be restricted to the original user context.
