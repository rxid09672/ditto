  Establishes persistence by creating a mail rule in the macOS
  Mail application that executes an AppleScript stager when
  emails with specific trigger words in the subject line are
  received. Configures the Mail application to automatically
  run the Empire agent stager when matching emails arrive,
  providing a covert persistence mechanism. Supports custom
  rule names and trigger words for flexibility. Includes
  safety checks for security software detection. Useful for
  maintaining access through email-triggered execution and
  establishing persistence that activates when specific
  emails are received.
