  Performs DNS resolution to translate hostnames, domain names, or FQDNs
  to their corresponding IPv4 addresses using Python's socket library.
  Leverages the remote agent's network configuration and DNS settings
  to resolve hostnames through the target system's DNS infrastructure.
  Provides essential network reconnaissance capabilities for mapping
  hostnames to IP addresses and understanding network topology.
