  A macOS-specific Active Directory enumeration module that leverages the
  Directory Service command line utility (dscl) to query group membership
  information using the current user's authentication context. This module
  performs targeted reconnaissance to identify users with elevated privileges
  within specified groups.

  The module uses dscl to query Active Directory for group membership data
  without requiring explicit LDAP credentials, relying instead on the current
  user's domain authentication. This approach is particularly useful in
  macOS environments where dscl provides native Active Directory integration
  and can access domain information through the system's directory services.

  The enumeration results provide critical intelligence for privilege escalation
  and lateral movement by revealing users with administrative access and
  understanding the domain's security group structure. This module is essential
  for macOS-based domain reconnaissance and helps operators identify potential
  targets for credential harvesting and privilege escalation attacks using
  native macOS directory service capabilities.
