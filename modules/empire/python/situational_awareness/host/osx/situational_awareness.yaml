  A comprehensive macOS host enumeration module that performs essential
  situational awareness gathering for operational planning and target
  analysis. This module collects critical system information to understand
  the target environment and identify potential attack vectors.

  The module enumerates basic system information including user accounts,
  installed applications, network configurations, and recent user activity.
  This information is essential for understanding the target's environment,
  identifying potential vulnerabilities, and planning subsequent attack
  strategies based on the discovered system state.

  The enumeration results provide critical intelligence for operational
  planning by revealing the target's system configuration, user behavior
  patterns, and potential attack surfaces. This module is fundamental for
  host reconnaissance and helps operators understand the target environment
  to identify the most effective attack vectors and persistence mechanisms.
