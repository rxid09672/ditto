  Establishes lateral movement by deploying an Empire agent launcher
  to remote systems via SSH. Uses password authentication to connect
  to target systems and executes the Empire launcher script to
  establish a new agent connection back to the specified listener.
  Includes safety checks for security software like LittleSnitch
  and sandbox detection to avoid detection. Supports configurable
  User-Agent strings for the staging request. Useful for lateral
  movement across network segments, establishing persistence on
  remote systems, and expanding the attack surface through
  legitimate SSH connections.
